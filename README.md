The Adelheid is a 75% Alice-like keyboard.  
It's a fork of FateNozomi's Arisu files: [Arisu PCB](https://github.com/FateNozomi/arisu-pcb) &amp; [Arisu case](https://github.com/FateNozomi/arisu-case)

This repo is a hand-wired version fork from [floookay's Adelheid]: https://github.com/floookay/adelheid with some changes.


This repository includes files for:

- a layered case &rarr; [README.md](./case/README.md)

## Changes in this fork

Here is a list of things I added in this fork in comparison to the original Adelheid:

- [x] replaced page up with a rotary encoder
- [x] lowered home, end, and page up keys
- [x] added win and right control keys
- [x] used pro micro as the controller
- [x] changed thickness of some acrylics
